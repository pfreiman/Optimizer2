Consider using the HAS-BLED Score as a tool to potentially guide the decision to start anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation.
Consider using the HAS-BLED Score instead of, or in conjunction with, other bleeding risk scores such as HEMORR2HAGES and ATRIA to determine risk of major bleeding in a patient with atrial fibrillation.
Consider comparing the risk for major bleeding as calculated by the HAS-BLED Score to the risk for thromboembolic events by the CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc to determine if the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the risk.
