The HEART score is a scoring system for patients presenting with chest pain at the emergency department. By assigning zero, one, or two points — towards a patient history, ECG abnormalities, the patient's age, any risk factors present, and troponin measurement — patients receive a score on a scale of 0‒10. The HEART score has been validated in several studies and has proven to be a powerful, easy, and above all practical instrument to separate patients into a low, medium and high risk groups. Patients scoring 0-3 have a 1.6% chance of experiencing a cardiac event, those with a score 4-6 have a 13% chance, and those scoring 7 or higher have a 50% chance of developing a myocardial infarction, PTCA, CABG or death within 6 weeks following presentation. With the HEART score it is immediately clear which patient is eligible for discharge without additional tests or emergency invasive procedures.
