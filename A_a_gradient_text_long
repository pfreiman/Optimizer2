Clinical Implications

Measuring the A-a gradient helps narrow the cause of hypoxemia as
either extrapulmonary (outside of the lungs) or intrapulmonary
(inside of the lungs); in other words, to distinguish hypercapnic
respiratory failure due to global hypoventilation (extrapulmonary
respiratory failure) from respiratory failure due to abnormal gas
exchange from intrinsic lung disease. An A-a gradient within the
normal range (< 20 mm Hg) in the setting of an elevated PaCO2 is
highly suggestive of global hypoventilation, whereas a widened
gradient (> 20 mm Hg) suggests that underlying lung disease may
be contributing to the measured hypercapnia.
