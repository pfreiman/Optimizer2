The CHADS2 score and its updated version, the CHA2DS2-VASc score, are clinical prediction rules for estimating the risk of stroke in people with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and serious heart arrhythmia associated with thromboembolic stroke. Such a score is used to determine whether or not treatment is required with anticoagulation therapy or antiplatelet therapy,[1] since AF can cause stasis of blood in the upper heart chambers, leading to the formation of a mural thrombus that can dislodge into the blood flow, reach the brain, cut off supply to the brain, and cause a stroke.

A high score corresponds to a greater risk of stroke, while a low score corresponds to a lower risk of stroke. The CHADS2 score is simple and has been validated by many studies.[2] In clinical use, the CHADS2 score (pronounced "chads two") has been superseded by the CHA2DS2-VASc score ("chads vasc"[3]), which gives a better stratification of low-risk patients.

Classification of CHADS2 vs CHADS2-VASc:

In both scoring systems, a score of 0 is "low" risk of stroke, 1 is "moderate", and any score above 1 is a "high" risk. 

Gender and the Caveat to CHA2DS2-VASc:

In general, a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 should warrant strong consideration for full oral anticoagulation.2 The one exception, however, is in patients who have a score of 1 due to gender alone. In these patients (female < 65 years old without other risk factors), antithrombotic therapy should not be given. This special situation may not be intuitive with the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system.
